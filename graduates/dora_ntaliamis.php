		<br />
		I enjoy Yoga, meditation, circuit training, bike rides, walking, hiking and recently started dancing. I insist on breaking it up by doing various physical and rewarding activities. Since incorporating these activities and a healthy positive lifestyle, I have found subtle changes in my approach to life. I feel more powerful and stronger both mentally and physically and we all know true changes start from your state of mind. I haven't always felt this way! I have to admit to trying a few too many diets that never worked for long and then feeling disappointed. Until one day I decided to take a different journey one were I would take ownership for what goes into my body and by taking this first step I entered a whole new world. I now only take part in activities I enjoy and always emphasis to people to do what they enjoy or find a fun way to do it.<br />

		<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
		I have wanted to study health and fitness for many years. But it wasn't until this year that I decided to finally take that challenge. What timing! Donna Aston decided to start her academy, and who better to learn from than someone who is so passionate and driven in educating people in health, fitness and nutrition. I had already read her books and was first inspired to take up weight training after reading Fat or Fiction. It's that simple!!
