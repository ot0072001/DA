I have been a client of Donna&#39;s studio for over 12 months and have been inspired and motivated by Donna and her team. Overcoming my own personal health and fitness issues, I have felt inspired to help others in a similar situation. Learning from a true leader in the health and fitness industry has been a very fulfilling experience, and I can&#39;t wait to be able to pass this knowledge on to family, friends and the rest of my prospective clients.<br />
