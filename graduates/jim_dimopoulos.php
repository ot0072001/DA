Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span>
<br />
I have always had an interest in health, sport and training. I played competitive sport for fifteen years and stopped after a serious injury. When the opportunity to learn from a leader in the health and fitness industry presented itself, I didn't need to think twice. For me it was like serving an apprenticeship with the best in the business. The course structure, presenters, mentors, and guest speakers help set this course apart from all the others. There really is no substitute for Donna Aston and her team of professionals. Hence, why I was lucky I waited to enrol for this particular course.
