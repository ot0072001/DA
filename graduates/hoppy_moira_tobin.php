True to her passionate nature, Hoppy was prepared to repeat her Certificate IV with me in order to glean as much knowledge as possible and ultimately, become the best trainer she can be. Her enthusiasm to help her clients reach their goals is commendable and I am proud to have her represent the Donna Aston Brand in her career ahead."
