		<br />
		I have a general interest in health, fitness &amp; wellbeing not only for myself but for my family, friends and people in general. I want to make the most out of life &amp; see other&#39;s do the same. Through completing the Donna Aston Personal Training course I also have a new found interest of the human body. I am interested in many sports and enjoy following the AFL (Go Blues!). I enjoy people and nothing makes me feel better than making someone else feel better.

		<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span>
		<br />
		I become interested in health and fitness through working out in the gym with a personal trainer; I wanted to learn more about a better quality of life &amp; wellbeing. I wanted to take on a new challenge and learn from someone held in high regard within the industry. I was looking for a course which would provide me with quality information, support and the confidence to hit the ground running when qualified. When I met with Donna I knew her standards were high therefore I knew anything Donna put her name to would be of high standard.

		Completed Run for the Kids fun run 14.7kms - first fun run I have ever done and I didn&#39;t need to use my Ventolin! Consistent training at the gym was all the preparation I had done. What a difference working out can make!

			<div class="quote">"Alana continued to surprise me as the course progressed. Her decision to commence her Certificate IV was, in her eyes, a little impulsive. However, what I witnessed was Alana really coming into her own. Her genuine inquisitive nature, coupled with her passion for helping others achieve their goals made Alana a stand-out student and now an equally commendable Personal Trainer."
