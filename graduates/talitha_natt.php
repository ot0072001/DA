<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />

After spending seven years in the HR &amp; Recruitment Industry I realised it was time for a change. I wanted to do something that incorporated my love of helping people and of course my love of Health &amp; Fitness. I had always thought that being a Personal Trainer would be a very satisfying job as I would be helping people reach their goals whilst working in a fun, supportive environment. I took a leap of faith and said goodbye to my old career and 'hello' to my new found career as a Personal Trainer. Donna's course was highly recommended to me by a friend in the Industry and I must say the course has been fantastic and I now can't wait to get out there and put my skills to use!
