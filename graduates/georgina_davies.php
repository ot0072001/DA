<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
I have always been very active and was a former medallist in State &amp; National track running and cross country.<br />
<br />
Wanting to help people achieve their health &amp; fitness goals has always been a passion in my heart, yet it wasn't until my competitive running was put on hold due to becoming a mother that I decided to acknowledge my passion &amp; pursue my career in personal training.<br />
<br />
After having my first child 2 years ago and being faced with the challenge (as many women do) to get my pre-pregnancy body back, I realised that despite a lifetime of being fit &amp; healthy I was still overcome by this challenge.<br />

<br />
By following Donna's exercise &amp; nutrition principles, I have transformed my body back to the way it was before I had my child and was able to do this without all the intense athletics training I previously did (which often caused injuries!).<br />
<br />
I have learnt to eat better, exercise smarter and I am happier, healthier and more energetic than ever before!<br />
<br />
I am so excited and passionate about sharing this knowledge I have learnt (and continue to learn) with my family, friends and clients!
</p>
<p>
<span><span class="green_text">Further Comments:</span></span><br />
I can't thank Donna &amp; her staff enough for teaching me such valuable knowledge that has changed my life in so many positive ways!
