<span class="green_text">Interests/Areas of speciality:</span> <br />
I am especially interested in training beginners and clients returning to exercise after a break, such as childbirth or injury. I like to focus on good nutrition and balance between various areas of fitness, including strength, endurance, flexibility and good posture. I believe that exercise must be fun, because we need to continue it throughout our life.

I have always been involved in sport and fitness ¨C right from my childhood but I needed to learn how to become a trainer. Donna is a very well respected fitness professional and her course offered more expertise than others.  I am also looking forward to learning more about CIRQ training through other courses offered by Donna.<br />
