<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
I have been instructing group exercise classes on a casual basis around full time jobs for a number of years.  After making the decision to pursue a full time career in the fitness industry, I started researching training organisations that delivered Certificate IV in Fitness.  After contacting numerous providers, I came across Donna's Academy and made an appointment to meet Donna to discuss the course.  The focus on nutrition, body composition analysis, corrective exercise/postural assessment, biomechanics and programming is what set the course apart from others for me.  One of the most valuable components of the course was actually spending one-on-one time with Donna and having her provide me with feedback and advice.<br />

<span class="green_text">Further Comments:</span> <br />
My personal mission is to 'get people moving' and to inspire them to 'live their best life'.  With my background and training in life coaching, personal training, dance and group exercise - I am looking forward to continuing to provide my clients and participants with the motivation, advice, support and variety they need to really reach their potential!<br />
