<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
Nutrition! Donna is very passionate about this topic and so am I. When I finished reading her first book, Fat or Fiction, I just knew that I wanted to complete my certificate IV in fitness with Donna and her team. Also, my decision was made easy by Donna teaming me up with one of her great Senior Trainers. This is part of Donna mentor approach to learning. I was able surround myself in her studios. I gained great experience from this and was able understand that every client is different, and they all have different needs and goals.<br />
<br />
Your body is your temple. So look after it! Eat healthy, exercise, and rest! The benefits to leaving a healthy lifestyle are endless. Health and fitness is my passion. It's great fun!
