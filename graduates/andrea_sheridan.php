<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
I have always been passionate about health and fitness.  Being involved in the Fitness Industry over the past 6 years and seeing the lack of commitment, passion and drive from some trainers, key areas clients need to achieve personal goals, inspired me to become a personal trainer.  Having followed Donnas career, attending her seminars, reading her books, seeing and feeling her passion for nutrition and exercise, l knew that Donnas Academy would be the right place for me to learn and acquire the correct skills to give client's the results they are after.  Knowing l will have the ability to gain ongoing support, information, future training and guidance from Donna and her team is invaluable to me as a Trainer.<br />
