Identifying goals and supporting people to reach them is not unlike nursing. I like enjoy building relationships and making a difference. I have a strong interest in nutrition and enjoy sharing information and ideas with clients. I enjoy working with women and am developing training programs for people recovering from treatment for cancer.
