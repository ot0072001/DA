<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Interests/Areas of speciality:</span> <br />
Boxing/Martial art based workouts.  Circuits and odd object training such as ropes, sledgehammers, tyres etc.  Self Defence training focussing on using a minimum number of techniques and principles to deal with a maximum number of scenarios.   I currently train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and self defence and am also a keen swimmer and have completed a couple of half ironman triathlons along with countless sprint and Olympic distance events .  I can no longer run however it hasn't stopped me pursuing my fitness goals in other areas.

<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />

I have always had a passion for keeping fit and I when I finally decided to do a personal training course, training with one of the most respected names in the business was the logical choice.  Throughout the course, the level of professionalism shown by Donna and her trainers simply reinforced that I had made the right choice.

My goal is to show people that being healthy and fit doesn't have to be a chore and can be fun and invigorating.  Have a healthy disregard for the impossible!!
