Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
I have worked in the Corporate world for many years, but have been about fitness for more than 20 years.  I have studied nutrition extensively, and have been heavily associated with body shaping and body sculpting/building for more than 12 years. I decided it was time to formalise my experience with a Fitness Trainer qualification. My aim is to help people achieve their health and fitness goals by sharing my knowledge and experience and success. I genuinely want to help people achieve their best and then go beyond what they ever dreamed they could achieve.
