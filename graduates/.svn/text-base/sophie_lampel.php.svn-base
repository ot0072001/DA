<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span>

<br />
I've always been interested in fitness and fairly active. I've struggled with my own body weight over the years and since training at Donna Aston myself I got the results I'd been after without crazy dieting or working myself into the ground. Donna's course appealed to me as it offered more than the standard fitness training courses. There are a lot of trainers out there and I wanted to be trained by the best!

<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Further Comments:</span>
<br />
As an actor it's important to have another 'job' in such a fickle industry. I'm lucky to have found two things that give me great satisfaction; acting and fitness.
