<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
After running my first half marathon, my passion for health and fitness exploded . Overcoming my own personal health and fitness issues, I felt inspired to help others to do the same. Learning from Donna Aston is the best and, I feel, the only way. Donna 's mentor system really help to guide me throughout my schooling and will always be a great continued support base even after graduation. Learning from a true leader in the fitness and weight loss field has been a very fulfilling experience.
