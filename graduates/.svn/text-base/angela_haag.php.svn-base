		<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
		I have followed Donna's principles of health and fitness for some time. I had looked into other personal training courses but was not comfortable in what they had to offer. When the opportunity came up to attend Donna Aston's Fitness Academy I knew it would be run with professionalism and dedication. The availability of a 'mentor' has been an invaluable experience. Donna Aston's personal trainers have been fantastic in providing assistance during training.
