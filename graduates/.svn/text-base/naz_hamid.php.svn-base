<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Interests/Areas of speciality:</span> <br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
There are so many fitness training organisations out there that don't emphasise practical experience, therefore making it very difficult for clients to find a good quality personal trainer that knows what they are doing. I wanted to become a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer to help ensure that I would be taught well, giving me a leading edge in the industry.
