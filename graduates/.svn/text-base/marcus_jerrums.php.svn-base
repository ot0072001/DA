<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span>
<br />
Initially I began reading Donna's books many years ago, I found the information offered clear succinct, relatable and most importantly do-able; a welcome relief in comparison to many other authors offerings on health and fitness. 
</p>
<p>
When the opportunity arose to join the Fitness Academy, passion and common sense prevailed and I had to take it and give my-self the chance to begin a higher quality of development in fitness and training. One I am sure I won't regret.

What you desire for yourself is already inside of you-if you can imagine it, you can feel it, if you want it, dare to live it.....learn the tools to create it, have some fun with it and along the way you will obtain it.
