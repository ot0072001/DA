<span style="font-size: 12pt" class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span> <br />
After going through the process of rehabilitation for injury, I decided it was time to help others achieve their goals. The team at the Donna Aston Fitness Academy have equipped me with the knowledge needed for my training and how to help people reach their goals and overcome injury. I have a great ambition to help others achieve their goals and lead a healthy and fit lifestyle!<br />
<br />
After completing Half Ironman Triathlons and trekking to Everest Base Camp earlier this year, I have realised anything is possible.<br />
