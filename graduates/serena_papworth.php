<br />
I was inspired to embark on the Donna Aston Certificate IV in Fitness after training at her Windsor Studio and achieving results beyond my own expectations.  Donna's holistic and professional approach, and her commitment to the delivery of the very best personal training services, meant that I knew that I would receive the very best training and experience available.
