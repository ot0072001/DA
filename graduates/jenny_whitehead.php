<span class="green_text">Areas of specialty:</span>
<br />
Having known the many benefits of exercise and fitness for a long time, I want to help and inspire others to achieve their goals in these areas.<br />
<br />
In particular, women in their 40's, 50's and 60's plus. Drawing upon my own experiences (as a mother of five!), as well as those of my friends and colleagues over the years, this is an area of expertise that I feel is my niche.<br />
<br />

Building a strong rapport with women of similar age and life experience is something I feel quite passionate about. Understanding the specific needs of individuals and working with them to achieve their personal health and fitness goals is my forte.

<span class="green_text">Why you became a Donna Aston Certified Fitness Trainer:</span>
<br />
I chose to complete my Certificate IV in Fitness at the Donna Aston Fitness Academy because having been a client of Donna Aston's Toorak studio for over two years, I know that Donna upholds the highest standards within the fitness industry and is considered an expert in the field of exercise and fitness.  I also know that upon completion of my Certificate that I will still have the resources available to me for as long as I need.

Having struggled with her own weight, Jenny has a great first-hand knowledge, motivation and empathy for others trying to reach specific health and fitness goals. I believe that there is a great need for specialist fitness professionals in the niche market of '50 plus women' and I have no doubt Jenny is the girl for the job!"
