<span class="green_text">Question:</span> How did you come into contact with the Donna Aston studio? 
</p>
<p>
<span><span class="green_text">Birgit:</span></span> For many years I had been frustrated with my weight and never seemed to be able to both lose and stablise it. I had read some of Donna&#39;s books and two years ago decided to ring the studio and ask Donna&#39;s advise. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> What were the following points like before you started? 
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Birgit:</span> Nutrition: I have always attempted to eat what I thought was &quot; healthy&quot; but at times I would succumb to the lure of the Junk Food outlets. 
</p>
<p>
Training/exercise: Since my early twenties I have always been active. I practiced all type of exercise including walking, running, gym and weight training and aerobics. All this time and effort never seemed to achieve the desired result. I have always lead an active life and when eating out tried to make the right choices. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> What was the biggest obstacle to overcome when you first started, and how did you overcome it? 
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Birgit:</span> The biggest obstacle when starting with Donna was that I was having to prepare two meals each day. One for my Husband, and one for myself. The easy way to solve this was to convince my husband to eat the same way as me!

Birgit has made some substantial, long-term lifestyle changes and the results in her health, energy and appearance are obvious. I hope this serves as an inspiration to all!"
