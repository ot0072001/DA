This is a heartfelt thank you for providing me the opportunity of enjoying life again, of feeling good to be in other peoples company, of enjoying wearing the clothes I wear. 
</p>
<p>
I am happy to admit I deserve some of the credit for this. I did change my diet, I did exercise regularly, and I did ensure that I attended training sessions to learn new exercises to help keep me motivated. 
</p>
<p>
However, this does not discount the following that were of tremendous benefit: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Donna's consultation at the beginning whereby she explained food habits and ways to avoid the traps</li>
	<li>My trainers (Lachi) excellent exercises that he taught me</li>

	<li>The free group discussions I was offered and attended</li>
	<li>The regular weigh-ins and advise on how to achieve my goals</li>
	<li>The delicious protein shakes that assisted me with my weight loss</li>
</ul>
<p>
Over the past twelve years I have attempted to lose weight by joining Gut Busters, Weight Watchers (I was the only male in the class which didn't help!) and regular attempts at joining the gym. I know these attempts at losing weight all failed because of the factors mentioned above NEVER being offered. In fact, I can't recall one personal trainer at these gyms ever showing the concern to assist me in achieving my goal to the extent that Lachi has. 
</p>
<p>
To Donna and the team, I hope you realise that your studios differ from others because you all care and you insist on results. There were no hints provided as to what I was doing wrong &ndash; rather you spelt it out. And somehow you spelt this out politely and encouragingly. I need and benefited from this directness, but never received it in the past. 
</p>
<p>

The result surely speaks for itself &ndash; my weight has dropped from 83kilos to 72 kilos in 5 months and my body fat has dropped from 27% to 20% at the same time. <u>And I mean it when I say that it wasn't hard to do!</u> 
</p>
<p>
Ironically, I was frustrated at the start because I knew I was losing weight but my friends and family weren't noticing. Now I'm actually getting tired of hearing everyone telling me how fantastic I look &ndash; isn't that proof of a great result! 
</p>
<p>
I welcome allowing anyone to read this testimonial as I truly appreciate this programs ability to do for me what many others have failed to achieve before. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you again Donna, Lachi and the team. You really are all legends in my eyes.
