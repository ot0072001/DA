<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Louise:</span> At 42, I was a very late starter when it came to exercise and had been on the yo-yo dieting merry-go-round for many years, always looking for a quick fix and thinking I could buy the answer in the latest &quot;diet book&quot;.  In 2002 I made some significant lifestyle changes and choices after reaching the point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired all of the time; and since then have a lifestyle that includes physical activity and good nutrition as a normal part of my daily routine.  While keeping up a regular training routine, I still struggled with maintaining my weight due to the fact that I had not really hit on the right formula that could be easy to follow and sustainable for the long term.

<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now?
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Louise:</span> I just know what I have to do and choose to do it. I don&#39;t need to look up books or refer to diet sheets anymore as it is automatic because it is so simple. I never skip breakfast and eat five smaller meals each day with not more than 2-3 hours between meals. I am much more mindful of the value of water and staying hydrated for body mind and performance so keeping track of water intake on a daily basis to keep the levels up is also part of my lifestyle and routine.

<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston¡¯s principles?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Louise:</span> I have maintained regular weight training activity 3 -4 times per week since 2002 with regular walking as part of my weekly routine, prior to that I did nothing!
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity/dietary changes now?

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Louise:</span> I had a very clear and specific goal to compete in female figure bodybuilding which required discipline and maintaining focus over an extended period of time.  Having a structure in place to monitor my fat loss (as opposed to weight loss) while maintaining and building lean muscle was key to my success.  The projected forecast with weekly goals and monitoring ensured I was on track to meeting my ultimate goal by a set deadline.  By keeping food clean and simple it was quick and easy to be prepared, to shop and to stay on track.  The introduction of Cirq training to my weekly training routine has been a fabulous addition, providing me with a new stimulation that is fun as well as challenging.  My core strength and balance has improved immensely and my overall condition particularly in my upper body has taken me to a new level.  It is great to know you are never too old to learn new tricks like handstands, and doing work on the rings and trapeze.

<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire others?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Louise:</span> For me I work best and get the best results when I have clear and compelling goals that time bound and realistic and a structure and program in place to achieve them.  Acknowledging the small wins along the way is as important as the end goal.  I also need to keep raising the bar and setting new goals to stay motivated.  I started integrating physical activity into my life at 42, competed in my first competition at 45, my second at 49 and I will do it again this year after I turn 50. The most important thing I have learned is that is never too late, you are never too old and anything you set your mind to is possible, you just have to want it badly enough.
