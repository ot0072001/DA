<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet &amp; lifestyle before starting with our program? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Glen:</span> I had always considered my diet to be healthy before starting with Donna &ndash; I ate regular meals and always had plenty of fruit and vegetables, however, it was not until I was 're-educated' by Donna's program that I realised how wrong I had been. My diet, while containing all the right foods, contained many additional and unnecessary components that were slowing my metabolism and causing me to gain weight. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet &amp; lifestyle now? 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Glen:</span> I now have much more energy and vitality. My diet is much more balanced, but no less satisfying. Even my partner, who is a very picky eater (and love junk food!), approves of and enjoys the recipes in Donna's books! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston's principles? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Glen:</span> I didn't really do any regular exercise apart from walking the dog and found that every time I was inspired to exercise for health reasons it would feel futile. I would generally end up disappointed and unmotivated. 
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity and dietary changes now? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Glen:</span> Since starting Donna's program I now exercise twice a week with my trainer (Lachi), and once or twice at home, substituting car trips with my bike or a walk whenever I can. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire other? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Glen:</span> Donna's facilities allowed me to achieve my fitness goals without the embarrassment of going to a public gym and making a fool of myself. The trainers are friendly and understanding, while not afraid to give me that extra push when needed.
