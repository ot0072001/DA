<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Michael:</span> Prior to commencing my training with Will, I  did not focus on eating the right foods and was often partaking in high calorie foods such as fried food, takeaway meals and processed /gimmicky food.. I did not have a structured training routine prior to joining Donna Aston fitness. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Michael:</span> I am much more focused on eating balanced and nutritionally sensible food and make it my goal to shop for healthy meals at the supermarket.  When eating out, I avoid ordering fried food and prefer to order grilled fish, veggies and salads instead.  My trainer Will Goldenberg has helped me to completely change my attitude to exercise and training. He has been able to keep me focused on my goals to reduce body fat and increase my overall fitness.  The workouts are constantly changing and are never boring or predictable.  We keep trying new things to keep pushing for better results'
