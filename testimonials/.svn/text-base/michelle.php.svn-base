<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting the Donna Aston program? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Michelle: </span>I was a junk food addict and binge eater. I would never eat breakfast and rarely ate lunch. Most of my eating was done between 5pm &amp; 10pm and it was full of processed carbs. Like most people I lead a very busy lifestyle with work. I am also a mother of three, constantly tired etc' and used this as and excuse not to eat well. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Can you describe your lifestyle now? <br />
<br />

<span class="green_text">Michelle: </span>Now I never miss breakfast, lunch or dinner, or my snacks in between &ndash; now only eating all the good things &ndash; no processed food in sight! I drink at least 2.5 litres of water per day, and my energy levels and mental clarity have improved remarkably. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before starting our program? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Michelle: </span>In previous years did a lot of sport, but due to work and family life, could only manage a run 2-3 times per week. Now I make sure I run 4-5 times per week, and walk on the other 2 days, along with doing strength and resistance training twice a week. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Do you have any comments you would like to make that may inspire others? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Michelle: </span>Be true to yourself. I came along to Donna Aston expecting to lose weight and tone up, however what I discovered was that the program actually changed my perspective on life and equipped me with the tools to lead a healthier lifestyle.
