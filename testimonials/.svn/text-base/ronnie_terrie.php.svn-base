<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Ronnie:</span> I actually thought I was quite fit and healthy. Having a few glasses of wine and take away every week was something I did. It was my treat after a long, hard week.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Terrie:</span> Before starting with Donna Aston my diet was not too bad. A naturopath had started me on the right track but often on Friday night and the weekends a pizza would appear with 2 bottles of wine between my sister and I. My thinking was I could treat myself over the weekend because I had been good all week.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now?

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Ronnie:</span> My diet and lifestyle have changed quite a lot. I'm finding I have more energy and sleeping so much better. I use to love eating chocolate. At first I thought, oh no! But now I don't have the cravings and I go for a more nutritional snack. I actually have re-educated myself about food with all the info I have received from Donna Aston.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Terrie:</span> I have never been more healthy in my life! I buy everything fresh and start from scratch, even my salad dressing is made fresh. No more Friday night and weekend junk food and alcohol intake has dropped to one day a week. There are no more afternoon slumps. I work for myself and I find I get through the day with a lot more energy.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston's principles?
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Ronnie:</span> Before this program all I did was 3 spin classes a week. That was pretty much it. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Terrie:</span> I would go and do my spin classes 3 to 4 times a week and occasionally walk on the weekends. Sometimes a body pump class would be done but over time doing the same routine every week I found it boring. My thinking was with all this cardio my fat would eventually move, not fully understanding that what you put in your mouth makes a huge difference 7 days a week - not just 5. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity/dietary changes now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Ronnie:</span> Now I walk everyday for an hour in the morning, no matter how cold it is and I do a 1 hour training session each week. Whenever there is an opportunity I will walk. In regards to diet I'm eating so much healthier now. More vegetables, salads, fish and chicken. Everything I cook is from scratch and I don't eat any processed food.

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Terrie:</span> My sister and I do an 1 hour training session with our great trainer Lachi once a week. What I love is every session week to week is different. There is no boredom and every week as we get stronger we are challenged to go the next step. We also walk 5 days a week for an hour every morning. It's a great way to start the day.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire others?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Ronnie:</span> I must admit I didn't believe the change was possible. I thought I was doing all the right things! When the weight started to drop off I could not believe my eyes. There is no going back now. Donna Aston has just been fantastic and this has changed my life dramatically in so many ways.
</p>

<p>
<span class="green_text">Terrie:</span> Try it! I was the biggest sceptic. When we had our first training session I walked in thinking this is going to be like any other. By the end of it I could not wait to book my next session in. It was fun and that what exercise should be.
