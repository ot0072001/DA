<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Chris:</span>I have tried many diets before where I initially lost weight only to put it back on again soon after. Overindulging in sweets and rich foods was a common pastime and maintaining a healthy weight was always a challenge for me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Chris:</span> I follow Donna's principle very closely. I don't find it difficult to keep to them as the foods recommended are all satisfying and enjoyable. There is no 'dieting' or deprivation - its all about making the right choices. Through reading Donnas books I found that this gave me a better understanding  behind the importance of choosing the right foods.

<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston's principles?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Chris:</span> Whilst I was quite sporty in my youth I became completely inactive for a number of years until a minor health scare prompted me into action. I started by doing some power walking and gradually building up to regular running. I had previously found weight training boring and uninspiring and didn't enjoy the traditional gym environment.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity/dietary changes now?
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Chris:</span> Thanks to Nikii guidance I now do a lot more cross training including weight work, TRX and a variety of cardio drills. She varies each session constantly keeping it interesting motivating and challenging.I look forward to each session with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire others?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Chris:</span> If you want to enjoy the many benefits that good health and fitness can give you, Donna has the methods and, together with her great team of trainers, can ensure you achieve your goals.
