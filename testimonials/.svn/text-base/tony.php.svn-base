<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Tony:</span> Three and a half years ago my exercise consisted of golf once a week and the occasional walk. Playing eighteen holes of golf became hard work and I knew I had to do something if I wanted to improve or even maintain my handicap. Having tried numerous personal trainers over the years with only modest success, I thought I would give Donna Aston a try.
</p>
<p>
The small gym and personal nature of the training appealed to me as I have never really enjoyed the gym environment. For 3 years my fitness and strength improved significantly but my weight loss was negligible. This was a frustration not only to me but also Nikii who questioned my will power to lose weight! At this point we decided to analyse my diet (she called it the "Intervention meeting") and it was not pretty.
</p>
<p>
My diet then was basically what ever I felt like. Blue cheese (yum), Maggie Beers Pate on a bread stick (outstanding) and the escargot from Frou Frou (ship it in). I was also partial to an afternoon coffee and Garibaldi at Browns on the weekend. The pies from Pie on High got an occasional workout as did the liquorice allsorts from the supermarket.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now?

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Tony:</span> Gym Saturday and Sunday, golf once a week, training at Aston Fitness Monday morning, walking Chip the dog for a minimum of 30 minutes most evenings. The amazing thing is that I now enjoy going to gym as I know I will feel better for the exercise.
</p>
<p>
Diet now is no bread, no pasta, no rice, no potatoes, and no cakes/sweets. No beer - four glasses of Pinot Noir a week and no white wine&hellip;and definitely no G&amp;T's. Plenty of water. The special muesli and protein powder for breakfast, HPLC bars for snacks and an apple instead of a Twix Bar! Salads at lunch. Protein with vegies or salad for dinner. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston's principles?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Tony:</span> Lethargic. Falling asleep on the couch after golf on the weekend was common.

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire others?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Tony:</span> Don't think exercise is the key. Diet is King, get your diet right. Ship in the special Aston muesli, cut out the beers, tell your partner to hide the chocolates; buy the health wrap at lunchtime, unravel the salad and throw the wrap out! Have your trainer write on your plan that he/she thinks you don't have the "will power" to do it and stick it on the fridge (reverse psychology). Stay out of the fridge after dark. Aim for incremental weight loss and set realistic targets but above all persevere and you too can lose 12 kilo's and get a testimonial! Last but not least if you lose weight invariably you will stop snoring. This is a win win. Your partner gets a good night's sleep and so do you because you don't get an elbow in the ribs and get told to turnover!
