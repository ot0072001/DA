<span class="green_text">Question: </span>How did you come into contact with Donna Aston Studio? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale:</span> I have a hair salon in the same street in Toorak, and for a year or so I admired some very fit looking trainers and clients of Donna's pass my salon. Eventually I took the plunge and walked up the stairs! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>What changes have you made to your diet/nutrition? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>I was basically not eating the right foods or enough of it. I would eat breakfast our everyday, which consisted of a cooked breakfast, including bacon, eggs or cheese on toast. Lunch was a sandwich and dinner depended on what was happening that night. I thought I was eating well but it took my trainer, Matt, to help me refine, understand and improve my total diet. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>What about training? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>I was training on and off at a local gym. Some weeks I would train 5 days and others not at all. I was going through the motions but I was not challenging myself and I was not getting any results for the time that I was putting into my training. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>And lifestyle? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>Like everyone else I was always busy, running my business and a home and with an active social life. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>What was your biggest obstacle? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>I think it was knowing how I wanted to look and feel, but I really did not believe that I could achieve my desired body shape. My main priority was that I wanted to gain muscle size and to achieve this goal I realised that this would be very much about my diet. With the advice and guidance from Matt, Donna and Lachi, things started to make sense. I got myself organised in the kitchen and made sure I had the right kind of foods at work for those hungry times during the day. <br />
<br />
Another obstacle was this was the first time that I had ever had any training advice before. I had to slow down and listen to the information on the exercise and listen to my body and focus on the muscle being worked. It now amazes me knowing how the body can change by focusing and concentrating on the exercise. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>What is your nutrition/diet like now? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>I now have 5 balanced meals a day, which consist of muesli, fresh vegetables, lean meats, fish and unprocessed foods. In my diet, I have also included a range of supplements, protein shakes and increased my water intake. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>And training/exercise? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>I now train three time a week for an hour each session. I walk The Tan most mornings with my dog, plus another walk in the evening. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>And your overall lifestyle now? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>My life is probably busier than ever, but with my focus on training, I now have more time and energy to complete my daily tasks. Training is now a regular part of my life and I feel alive, fit and well! 
</p>

<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Do you have any advice/tips for others attempting to achieve their health &amp; fitness goals? <br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Dale: </span>I would just recommend that you give it a good go. The easiest thing is not to do it. In fact, that last hour in bed is over in 5 minutes! So get up and into it and make it your new addiction. Also take full advantage of what Donna and her team have to offer in regards to their information, seminars, etc. I have learnt a lot!
