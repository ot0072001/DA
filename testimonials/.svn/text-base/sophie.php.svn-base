Before I started the program with Kris I really thought I was quite 'healthy and curvy'. It wasn't until I jumped on the scales that I discovered I was almost 32% fat! Wow! Although I was surprised, I think this was all the motivation I needed. The time had come to make a change. 
</p>
<p>
Before now, I would go to the gym in phases. I'd never really stick to any kind of program and found myself going around in circles. I'd get so frustrated with the lack of results that I would reward myself with food. I thought I could do this because I'd been to the gym! My previous diet on a typical day would have consisted of Muesli with lots of dried fruit or a huge bowl of oats and honey. Snacks would generally be hot chocolate...lunch a toasted sandwich and banana and for dinner, a huge serve of rice with chicken and vegetables, followed by peaches in syrup and ice-cream. And there would generally be more chocolate consumed throughout the evening! Come the weekend I would have around 10-15 alcoholic drinks.

With my new regime, my food intake looks something like this: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Breakfast:</strong> cherry smoothie (frozen cherries, Protein Supreme, flaxseed oil &amp; milk)<br />
<strong>Snack:</strong> 1 boiled egg or raw nuts<br />

<strong>Lunch:</strong> Chicken, fresh chilli lime and rocket salad<br />
<strong>Snack:</strong> Pear<br />
<strong>Dinner:</strong> Baked salmon with pumpkin, zucchini and spinach salad<br />
<strong>Dessert:</strong> Natural yoghurt and vanilla protein powder and blueberries 
</p>

I just got really creative with all my food adding fresh herbs and spices. Suddenly this started working for me my energy levels increased. I have to say I was very inspired by Donnas books - especially the chocolate fudge recipe! This was great for a chocolate treat. I just love chocolate and now I can still have it - guilt free! I'm always coming up with new recipes. It's amazing once you know what foods you can eat and how creative you can actually be while making the right choices. It was great keeping a food and fitness diary. Kris was always there to give me any advice I needed on how to make the right choices for training and food. Now I get up in the morning and do 45-minutes of cardio - walking, running or spin classes most days. Twice a week I do weight training with Kris and I swim. I do a lot or travelling and always make sure there is a gym in the hotel, or a beach close by to go for a run.

I tend not to drink alcohol very often now &ndash; only on very special occasions. My Sundays are usually spent going for a nice run or going crazy to some music in a class. Exercise and healthy living are my number one priority now and I am happy to say, has become a way of life. My goal was to have a body like a Victoria Secrets model, which sounds like quite a big call ... but once I had a picture in my head it gave me something to aim for and nothing was going to get in the way. 
</p>
<p>
I challenged myself by booking in for a photo shoot, which gave me such good incentive to train and stick to the plan. Knowing that I was going to be in front of a camera made me work so much harder! Once I reached my initial goals I had the photo shoot and I felt so proud of what I had achieved. 
</p>
<p>
My advice is, whatever you goal may be, stick to it and you will get the results. I can't thank Kris (my trainer) and the team at Donna Aston (Windsor) enough for helping me on my journey to better health and wellbeing ... and most of all, achieving my true potential.
