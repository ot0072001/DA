<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet &amp; lifestyle before starting with our program? 
</p>
<p>
<span><span class="green_text">Erez:</span></span> Before I started my training, I would wake up and eat leftovers from last night, which would be steak/rice or pasta couscous, or mashed potato and sausages. For lunch I would usually eat a home-made burger with Turkish bread, beef, lettuce &amp; mustard/mayo/tomato sauce. Before dinner I would usually eat candy/chocolate, and when it came time for dinner it would usually be the same thing as breakfast! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet &amp; lifestyle now? 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Erez:</span> Now I wake up and either cook some eggs or have a protein shake with strawberries &amp; banana. 
</p>
<p>
For lunch I have tuna and salad. 
</p>
<p>
For dinner I usually have steak &amp; salad or some lamb/chicken and salad. Sometimes I have yoghurt with fruit and a little bit of granola. 
</p>
<p>

I no longer eat potatoes, pasta, rice, bread or couscous. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston's principles? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Erez:</span> Before this program I used to train here and there...playing soccer with some friends at school. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity and dietary changes now? 
</p>

<p>
<span class="green_text">Erez:</span> I now exercise seven times a week, anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. In my training I do running, weight training, kick-boxing and cardio exercises. I've also started fire-twirling, playing soccer with my friends more often and running with the dog at the park. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you'd like to make that may inspire other? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Erez:</span> Donna Aston's program has given me a kick-start on my training. The more you push yourself, the better the results!

			<div class="quote">"I continue to watch Erez and his astounding transformation each and every week. He has not only shed almost 20kg in body fat, he has completely reshaped his body and made vast improvements to his overall health and wellbeing. Weighing just over 90kg's and 32% body fat when he began, Erez is now a lean 72.5kg and has reduced his body fat to 16%! All-in-all an inspiring achievement."
