<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Eliza:</span> Before beginning at Aston Fitness, I thought that my lifestyle and diet were good. I had just begun my first year of university after a year spent volunteering in Europe. I was quite active, playing tennis and waterpolo twice a week plus whichever after-school sport I had chosen for the term during high school. Food was usually toast for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and a 'meat and three veg' dinner. I snacked a lot on high sugar snacks such at muesli bars and juice boxes. I didn't participate in much sport during my year overseas. As a backpacker in the second half of the year I was eating a lot of 'quick and easy' foods, which were often high in sugar and carbohydrates. I would go out with friends and have around 3-4 alcoholic drinks per outing, which was usually followed by a fast food outlet visit. I found that often on the weekends, I would still be in bed at midday and I would get very tired throughout most days. I also had trouble getting to sleep before midnight.

<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Eliza:</span> My diet has gone from being high in sugar and carbohydrates, to being higher in protein and lower in sugar and carbohydrates. Instead of toast for breakfast, I'll have either a vanilla protein shake with some berries or some muesli with protein powder and natural yoghurt. As a snack I'll have a small handful of raw nuts, or a slice of cheese. For lunch I avoid bread and will often have a tuna salad or leftovers from the night before. Dinner has decreased in size and is still a 'meat and three veg' dish, but I've substituted things like potatoes and pumpkin with green, steamed vegetables. I make sure throughout the day to drink lots of water. I try to have 2L of water a day. I don't over-sleep like I used to, and I don't find myself getting tired during the day. The decrease in sugar in my diet has really helped me to keep my energy levels and mood at a consistent level. I'm more upbeat and I have a lot more energy. I hardly ever drink alcohol anymore, only on very special occasions, but I don't really miss it. A soda water with a slice of lime keeps me with a drink in hand and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.

<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before following Donna Aston's principles?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Eliza:</span> I played inter-school sport every year during high school and I have always been a passionate tennis player. Four years ago a friend suggested I try playing waterpolo. I loved it and played twice a week for the past four years. I didn't do any weight training and very little walking. I wasn't aware of the type of exercise I needed to do to lose weight.
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity/dietary changes now?
</p>
<p>

<span class="green_text">Eliza:</span> I work out in the gym with Matt twice a week, and I walk for half an hour each day. With Matt I work mainly on my strength and on alternating sessions we work on upper or lower body also focusing on my core strength. My favourite exercise is climbing the tissue. It's a really different and interesting type of exercise, and every week I try a new trick or combination of climbs. I usually do my walking to and from uni instead of catching a tram, it's a nice way to start and finish the day. On the days that I finish uni early, I go to the gym and run/jog on the treadmill for around 30/45 minutes. I usually try to fit in a run 3 times per week on top of my daily walk. I still play tennis twice a week but have recently stopped playing waterpolo.

<span class="green_text">Question:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire others?
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Eliza:</span> Losing weight is an extremely difficult task. Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight understands the difficulty. For me, the best part about going to Aston Fitness has been the support I have been given by everyone there. If ever I felt like it was all too hard, or that I was too busy or tired to train, Matt and Sally really helped me to re-focus on my goals and to keep a positive attitude. The hardest thing about changing your lifestyle is doing it alone. At Aston Fitness I never felt as though I was the only person committed to achieving my goals. The changes that I've seen in myself physically and mentally are my inspiration to keep bettering my physical appearance and as a result, my state of mind. The results I've achieved already inspire me to continue and keep setting new goals.
