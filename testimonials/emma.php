<span class="green_text">Question:</span> How did you first meet Donna and what was your lifestyle like before? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Emma:</span> I&#39;ve known Donna for a very long time now, which is interesting in itself in that I&#39;ve observed the progress and development of Donna&#39;s lifestyle &amp; personal &amp; professional philosophy on exercise &amp; diet. We first met when Donna was training at a body building gym back in the mid to late 80&#39;s. I was working in breakfast radio, tired &amp; overweight and the exposure to training and Donna&#39;s approach began a long interest for me. Though I&#39;d have to say that for the years since I&#39;ve really only adhered to a certain extent and therefore though quite fit &amp; healthy still carried quite a bit of excess weight that never seemed to budge.

<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> How have your lifestyle and food choices changed? 
</p>
<p>
<span><span class="green_text">Emma:</span> </span>My mum brought us up on a very healthy diet of fresh food and I studied Physical Education so I&#39;m fortunate in that I&#39;ve always had this behind what Donna says! With the challenge that Donna recently asked me to take, resulting in my having appear on national television, I thought - well I&#39;m not going to do that unless I do it properly! - so I have made various changes which through that commitment I&#39;ve found remarkably easy to stick to. It&#39;s been around 4 months and I&#39;ve simple cut out all the processed carbohydrates loaded foods and a couple of the more starchy carb foods and I feel better than ever, more energy and with the resulting weight loss -finding all things much easier to do! I eat great sized meals, I&#39;m never hungry and I really don&#39;t miss the pastas, bread, sugar, noodles (well a little!), rice (also a little!). I can easily continue eating the way I do, because once you start &quot;thinking outside the square&quot; there are so many different things you can do with a nice portion of protein and plenty of vegies or salad! 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> What do you consider to be the most significant benefit from the changes you have made? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Emma:</span> I never thought I&#39;d hear myself say it, (I&#39;ve never even owned a set of scale!) but the weight loss! For the first time since I was at school I&#39;m slim, clothes actually look good on my but above all I feel brilliant. In fact it&#39;s been proven more than ever this weekend just gone. I took out kids out of school Thursday and Friday of last week to take them camping to a great old friend&#39;s property in the High Country, about 3 and a half hours out of Melbourne. David, my husband was unable to come, so I was on my own - with a couple of families, but I did all the setting up of our tents and the camp, slept outside under the stars and we didn&#39;t stop all weekend, moving sheep, swimming in the river, very early mornings up with the birds, helping in the sheering shed - an all round farming weekend, packing everything back up and driving back the 3 and a half hours yesterday. I would normally be so shattered with tiredness, but I&#39;m not! I thought I&#39;d be nodding off while driving but I was as alert as can be and even went out to dinner when I got back. I can&#39;t believe how fresh I feel!

<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> You are a great cook Emma - do you have to be a gourmet expert to survive on this plan? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Emma:</span> You really don&#39;t, but my favourite way of looking at it is - &quot;think outside the square&quot; - there&#39;s no need to limit yourself, there&#39;s always different things that you can do. Think of different cuts and types of meat. Look hard in the green grocers - and try new and different vegies or salad - one of my favourites is the Asian cabbage - or wombok - it&#39;s delicious as a base for a salad, shredded finely - a basic coleslaw or add different herbs and anything you like to mix it up, and the harder, white stems close to the base are divine in a stir fry with other vegies! 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> What advice would you give anyone reading this who would like to successfully change their body and health? 
</p>
<p>
<span><span class="green_text">Emma:</span></span> Make a commitment and simply do it! Processed carbs are by their very name - not necessary in your diet, they&#39;re made by processing (God knows!) and have no nutritional value by comparison to the great carbs that fresh unprocessed foods contain! It&#39;s not extreme in any way, you can eat far more food than you ever would on some silly calorie restricting diet an once you&#39;re committed and &quot;thinking outside the square&quot; about what and how you&#39;re going to prepare your food, it becomes a very manageable lifestyle.

			<div class="quote">"I think you&#39;ll agree - Emma looks like a new person! I&#39;ve known Emma for many years and in addition to being a brilliant cook (friend and mum!), Emma is a die-hard foodie! She&#39;s always thought I was so strict in my personal eating regime, but it&#39;s not since she gave it a go herself to take part in a trial on &quot;What&#39;s Good For You&quot; on Channel 9 recently that she realised just how easy it can be! I&#39;m sure Emma&#39;s story will inspire others to follow her lead..."
