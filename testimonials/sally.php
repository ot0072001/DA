Sally has been a positive inspiration to many at my studio and an absolute pleasure to train. She came to us with an open mind and was willing to take on the challenge of creating a better body. Clearly, from the photos above, she has achieved this in a very short space of time. A total transformation! In fact, Sally and her washboard abs are something to be marvelled! Matthew has been working with Sally to create these changes and he recently conducted a short interview to learn more about her experience. I&#39;d like to thank Sally for generously sharing her story (and photos) with us and I have no doubt she will serve as an inspiration to many.

<span class="green_text">Matt:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting with this program? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Sally:</span> I considered my energy levels to be okay... or so I thought. My food choices were not too bad, but in hindsight, I did tent to indulge in too many pastries, cakes and breads. I was probably eating larger portions that I really needed and not exercising enough. I thought my knowledge on health and diet was pretty good, but I have since discovered that I was not that informed. I had tried different programs that friends had tried but didn&#39;t see any great results, so I would give it up, repeating this process many times in search of the &quot;right&quot; one. This was likely one of the reasons my motivation was up and down, again disappointed with I did not get results, blamed getting older and eventually found it easier to purchase clothing in bigger sizes.

<span class="green_text">Matt:</span> Can you describe your diet/lifestyle now? 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Sally:</span> My energy levels are nothing short of fantastic! My food choices/control is great and much cleaner foods and, unbelievably, no cravings! My motivation is at an all time high!! I can&#39;t stop spreading the word of new lifestyle and I am constantly being complimented on my skin, body shape, tone and general appearance and I will not go back to bad habits. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Matt:</span> Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before Donna Aston? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Sally:</span> I had a brief encounter with a personal trainer before starting with you. It was okay, but I did not achieve any great results. It was frustrating because I just kept paying money and not really changing anything. I exercise a lot, walking heaps... all with no major results because I did not really change my eating habits. I eventually lost interest and exercise less and less. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="green_text">Matt:</span> Can you describe your training/physical activity now? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Sally:</span> It&#39;s quite simple really... I walk 30-40 minutes every week-day, and 60 minutes Saturday and Sunday. I do sit ups, push ups, lunges, squats and dips twice a week (2 x 20 each). 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Matt:</span> Do you have any comments you&#39;d like to make that may inspire others? 
</p>

<p>
<span><span class="green_text">Sally:</span></span> I found Donna Aston provided me with a life changing, excellent program and common sense, easy to follow eating plan. As a result, I have moved fat from areas (thighs) I once thought I could never change. My skin looks fantastic. It used to be dry and dull, but now it&#39;s a lot softer and has a healthy glow. Basically I&#39;m a total convert and I have been astonished with my new found body, health and energy levels and I love it!!
