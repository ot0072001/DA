<span>Prior to starting at Donna Aston I had a reasonably healthy diet but did not really focus well on whether I was eating enough of the right sort of foods. My diet was too high in carbohydrate and had insufficient protein. In addition I tended not to eat lunch. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Having been with the program for a few months I have changed my diet markedly and am conscious of eating regular and nutritionally balanced meals. I certainly eat a lot more fruit and drink more water. My energy levels are now much higher throughout the day and I sleep better. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>I was active prior to commencing training with Donna Aston. I have a trapeze act which requires good core strength and upper body strength. I also swam regularly, so initially I was a bit sceptical about the results I might achieve. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>I now train with Lachlan three times a week in addition to walking regularly and continuing with my previous activities. I have found that the intensive training has increased my physical strength enormously. I have less body fat and I have much more stamina and energy. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>The Cirq-style of training is a fantastic way of increasing your fitness in a way which has none of the tedium of a traditional gym routine. For me it is especially good as it develops my acrobatic skills to a much higher level under professional supervision which is tailored to my needs. The use of the trapeze, rings, and parallel bars ensure that no two workouts are the same and that the degree of difficulty intensifies all the time. I have reached so many of my personal fitness goals as a result of the Cirq programme and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a challenging fitness routine which incorporates all the fun and exhilaration of the circus whilst building a much stronger and more powerful physique. </span>

</p>
<p>
<span>After initially been a bit doubtful, I cannot recommend Donna Aston highly enough. All the staff are great motivators and have a wealth of skills and knowledge which inspire confidence. I always feel I am moving forward with my goals and am confident that my trainer has a comprehensive plan to help me achieve the desired results. Staying motivated is the key to increasing and maintaining fitness and this is something that Donna Aston excels at. Many people join gym's only to lose heart and give up. This won't happen if you train at Donna Aston. I would highly recommend Donna Aston to anyone wanting to increase their strength, flexibility and overall fitness as well as making sustained and healthy changes to their lifestyle. </span>
