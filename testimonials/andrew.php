<span class="green_text">Question:</span> How did you first hear about Donna and what was your lifestyle like before you started training? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Answer:</span></span> I first heard about Donna and her Toorak Studio through a friend. I&#39;d attempted to lose weight on previous occasions. In fact, I put in a huge effort in 1996 and managed to lose 39 kilos in 8 month. Unfortunately, I stopped exercising and regained all the weight. 
</p>
<p>

At this stage I had low energy levels, poor food choices (I used to comfort myself) and no motivation. Due to many stresses in my life at the time there always seemed to be setbacks, which lead to further comfort eating and caused my weight to escalate. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> How have your lifestyle and food choices changed? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Answer:</span> Much better! I&#39;m a pretty hard taskmaster and I feel I still need to try harder, but with Donna and your help, work has been done on my&quot;head&quot; as well as my body. Now I have a much better understanding of myself and am able to listen and work with &quot;me&quot; to get what I want? -? ultimately, better results - a healthy, fit body to help me keep up with my two young sons! 

</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question:</span> What is your regime like now? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Answer:</span> I walk my dog each day and I train twice a week doing a combination of strength work and cardiovascular conditioning - a bit of a circuit style workout. It&#39;s time efficient and seems to be working for me. I alternate between Donna and her trainers. I&#39;m generally much more active these days and find I&#39;m now able to keep up with my two young boys. Life is so much fun, but there is still work to do. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Donna:</span> Thank you Andrew for taking the time to share your inspiring photos and story with us all and I look forward to seeing you achieve further weight loss and health gains!

			<div class="quote">"I&#39;ve watched Andrew&#39;s amazing transformation from the time he started training with us. While you can see from the photos that his physical changes are incredible... even more inspiring are the changes in his outlook, energy and self-esteem. I&#39;m so proud of what Andrew has achieved to date and I can barley wait to witness him reach his final goal. This time, his knowledge and attitude have transformed along with his body and I know his going to keep it off."
