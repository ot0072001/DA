<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Can you give us a brief history of your diet/lifestyle before starting the Donna Aston program?<br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Lisa: </span>For many years my lifestyle had been fairly sedentary. Working as a trauma counsellor involved many hours of sitting and I was too exhausted, emotionally and physically to engage in any healthy exercise. I then embarked on post graduate study for many years, whilst continuing to work full time and I was also on call at night which created more stress and fatigue. I had a diet that was based on processed carbohydrates and fast food that provided comfort and convenience. I was not making good choices that would have helped me to cope with stress and fatigue. <br />
<br />
The diet and lifestyle I had created over many years, was spiraling out of control and I lacked the mental and physical energy to make positive lifestyle changes. I was finally challenged to do something after sustaining a serious back injury whilst on an overseas holiday. I experienced what I can only describe as an 'epiphany' when a friend asked me to go with her to hear Donnas' presentation on how to achieve a healthier diet and lifestyle. I sat there and it all made so much sense, Donna could have been talking about me! <br />
<br />
I was very keen to start working with a trainer and get my diet and life under control. However, but I was quite anxious about whether I would be able to participate in exercise without hurting my self or experiencing more pain. How wrong those fears turned out to be. The journey to a fitter, healthier and pain free life is something I doubted I would ever be capable of achieving, but I am now well on my way to achieving my goals.

<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Can you describe your lifestyle now?<br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Lisa: </span>Donnas' initial consultation set realistic goals for weight loss with a healthy and very satisfying food plan. The years of skipping breakfast, feeling hungry in the afternoon and reaching for carbohydrate enriched snacks, were replaced by a schedule that swapped bread, pasta and rice for lots of fruit, vegetables and protein. It is a fantastic feeling to be just as energetic at the end of the day as it is when you first start the day! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Can you give us a brief history of your physical activity before starting our program?<br />
<br />
<span class="green_text">Lisa: </span>My physical activity before starting the program was negligible. I was very tired and became an expert at creating excuses. When I started at Donna's studio I began walking half an hour a day and training twice a week. My back loves walking so much I now walk for an hour in the morning and an hour at night. In the eleven months I have been training with Lachi, I have never experienced a time when I didn't feel safe under his supervision or pushed to a point where I might hurt my back. I am amazed at the things I can now do that I would not dared to have done before I started training. It is a wonderful feeling to no longer have to reach for the pain killers to make it through the day.

<span class="green_text">Question: </span>Do you have any comments you'd like to make that may inspire others?<br />

<br />
<span class="green_text">Lisa: </span>If you want to achieve real change in your life, please don't wait for a health crisis, like I did, to set you on a happier and healthier path. I feel that even a person such as myself who was highly stressed and had little energy and motivation can completely turn their life around. That old shampoo add, 'it won't happen overnight but it will happen', which has given us all a laugh, now has real meaning for me.
