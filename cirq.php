					<div class="title">Cirq: Body Training System</div>
					<div class="intro">The Cirq body training system was developed by fitness expert and author, Donna Aston, and gymnast/performance artist, Shannon McGurgan.
					</div>
					<div class="context">It is currently used extensively and with great success by all trainers at Aston Fitness. Our studio has been fitted out and designed to cater for advanced teaching of this method of training, using equipment such as roman rings, tissue, crash mats, static trapeze and parallel bars. Shannon has been training Donna Aston in modified acrobatic skills for many years now.  Starting as an absolute beginner, Donna and Shannon learned along the way to break down some of the more complex moves into individual and progressive skills. Donna soon realised that not only was this way of training fun, it was the most functional form of training she'd experienced! In fact, Donna considered this training so valuable that she persuaded Shannon to collaborate with her to create CIRQ. A form of modified acrobatics for people of all fitness levels.  From static trapeze to handstands and tumbling, CIRQ is putting the fun back into fitness!
