		<div class="popPara context">Will has been training in gyms himself for more than 8 years. It was this passion for health and fitness that lured him away from the corporate world (after completing a business degree) and into the fitness industry. Although Will has only been certified as a trainer since early 2008, his sporting background is extensive. In addition to his own training, he has played AFL football for Trinity for the last 6 years and was vice captain in 2008. Having recently shed 8 kilos of body fat himself, he has great empathy and motivation for clients wishing to lose weight and make significant changes to their physical condition. This, combined with his genuine desire to help his clients achieve their goals makes Will a valuable addition to our team.

			<div class="quote">"Will is one of our most recent recruits, joining the team in late 2008. One of the first things that struck me about Will is his unassuming nature and his amazing thirst for knowledge. He is motivated to be the best trainer he can be and is dedicated to helping others achieve their goals. Will is currently working as a Junior Trainer at Donna Aston Windsor and Toorak and is already having great success with his growing clientele".
