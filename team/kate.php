		<div class="popPara context">Kate joined the team at Aston Fitness in 2009. She left the corporate world to pursue her passion for health and fitness and currently multitasks as a receptionist and TRX instructor. Kate completed her Certificate IV in Fitness at the Donna Aston Fitness Academy and has since transformed her own eating habits and improved body composition. As a teenager, Kate represented Victoria in short course triathlons. She is now training for a half iron(wo)man competitions. Having had a full knee reconstruction in 2002 fuelled Kate's keen interest in corrective and rehabilitative exercise, as well as postural analysis and a general fascination with how the human body works!

			<div class="quote">"Kate's enthusiasm for health and fitness was obvious to me when she completed her Certificate IV at my Academy. Always eager to learn and participate, these qualities have carried over extremely well as she now plays an integral role as part of the Aston Fitness team. She is a natural and innovative leader when teaching in a small group environment. I'm thrilled to have Kate as part of our team"
