			<div class="popPara context">Richard is a talented trainer who loves exercise, has a wide range of experience in the fitness industry and a strong drive to help his clients succeed. 
			</div>
			<div class="popPara context">In his teens, Richard represented both Victoria and Australia in numerous baseball tournaments. At 15 years of age Richard injured his knee and was told he would never run again. Richard used his strength training as rehabilitation and, as a result, he's been running almost every day for the past 10 years - free of knee pain. After operating his own training studio for 4 years, Richard travelled overseas and upon his return joined the Donna Aston team.
