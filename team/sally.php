			<div>Manager - Aston Fitness</div>
		</div>
		<div class="popPara context">Sally joined the Aston Fitness team in 2006. Although the health and fitness industry is a change from Sally's previous career in the digital media world, it quickly became her passion after training with Matt and totally transforming her body-shape, health, energy and personal outlook on health and fitness.
		</div>
		<div class="popPara context">A total "convert" to this healthier way of life, it seemed a natural progression to follow-on in this industry. In her many roles as our studio manager, Sally also serves as a great inspiration to many of our clients, a living, breathing testament to how positive a healthier lifestyle can be.

Affectionately known as "Super-Sal" amongst staff and clients alike, she is the "glue" that holds this studio together for myself and all trainers. A true professional ... and I'm thrilled to have her onboard!"
