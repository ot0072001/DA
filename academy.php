							</div>
							<div class="context">The CIRQ body training system (1403) was developed by Donna Aston and gymnast/performance artist, Shannon McGurgan. It is currently used extensively and with great success by all trainers at the Donna Aston Fitness studios. The Donna Aston studios have been fitted out and designed to cater for advanced teaching of this method of training, using equipment such as roman rings, tissue, crash mats, trapeze and parallel bars. While this equipment is a great (and relatively inexpensive) addition to any training facility, your body weight is really the only 'tool' necessary for the introduction of CIRQ - developed to bring the fun back into training for trainers and clients alike.
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="context paraBlock">As a fitness professional, the addition of CIRQ to your repertoire will help you and your clients shift your training to the next level, developing skills and results previously never considered possible.
						</div>
						<div class="paraBlock">
							<div class="context">This is a Fitness Australia Approved program
							</div>
							<div class="context">Full-day workshops run intermittently throughout the year. <a href="career.php">Enquire today</a>
