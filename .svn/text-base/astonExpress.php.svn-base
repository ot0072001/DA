					<div class="context">Our state-of-the-art Cardio Zone and multi-functional TRX circuit are exciting new additions to our Personal Training services. Most of us are time-poor these days. At Aston Fitness we acknowledge that sometimes it's difficult to stick to appointment times. Our unique membership can complement Personal Training sessions by giving clients the opportunity to burn off a few extra calories on the treadmill, or try out something completely different (and challenging!) with our TRX small group classes. We currently have scheduled TRX classes which fill up fast, so bookings are essential. In addition to this, we can also create a class specifically for a group of colleagues and/or friends with a minimum of 6 participants. The cardio equipment includes top of the line Life Fitness treadmills with built-in entertainment systems and iPod docks, as well as summit trainers and spin bikes. Phone reception today on (03) 9827 8671 to find out more...
